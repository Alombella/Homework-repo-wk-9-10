   <!-- Doctype declaration is fine. You are missing the <head> section (and within it, the required <title> element, that marks your page with a title, used by Google and browsers, crucial to valid and findable web pages) that is required before the opening <body> tag. I will add it in with other comments and corrections so you can see the change when I issue a pull request to you. Always run your html past the HTML Validator at https://validator.w3.org and you can then ensure that your markup is valid.  -->

<p>Research in the internet age is easier than ever. With libraries moving most of their resources online it also increases accessibility. You are able to search up anything on the internet and you can find scholarly sources within seconds. You can also find sources that are not reputable as well, you just have to know where to look.</P>

<p>Books for research purposes are becoming more and more obsolete as the age of online text starts to take over. Hard copy book requires you to read through in hopes you find some information related to what you are looking for. Online text lets you search the entirety of the text for key words or phrases, and finding information is much easier.
